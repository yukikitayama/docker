# Registry

Docker Trusted Registry allows deleting images if the image has not been signed.

## Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)

By default, users with read and write access to a repository can push the same tag multiple times to that repository.
To prevent an image from being overwritten by another user, use DTR web UI to make the tag immutable.
